# 3x3_palindromes_and_anagrams

This simple project was part of my introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Java course. The program takes 9 characters from the user as input and uses this to fill a 3x3 grid. The program then provides a count of how many valid words exist in the grid, how many palindromes exists in the grid, as well as how many anagrams exists in the grid.

Palindrome: A word that reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g. mom).

Anagram: A word that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word (e.g. dad -> add).
